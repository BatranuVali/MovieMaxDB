                <p>Today marked the beginning of this project. At first, the basic outline for the page structure was defined in 3 sections as follows: Description, Implementation Details, and Updates.</p>
                <p>In the Description section, a brief overview of the project will be provided, explaining the purpose and functionality of the movie database website.</p>
                <p>The Implementation Details section will delve into the technical aspects of the project, discussing the technologies used, the structure of the code, and any unique implementation strategies.</p>
                <p>In the Updates section, a format was established to document the development journey. Each update will be presented as a distinct block, featuring a title, date, and a description of the changes made. This section will serve as a logbook, chronicling the progress of the project, and providing transparency on the development process.</p>
